What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn and develop the mindset of the upside down Scrum triangle since I am usually a person who takes on more than the time I have.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have a bit of experience in an engineering firm where we apply Scrum thoughout most division. 
Hopefully I have picked up one or two practical things there that I can share with the group. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have a large interest in Scrum so I hope my commitment will contribute to the group learning more through our cooperation. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We all have to be a part of all tasks in the group but I think I can contribute through structuring our tasks in a way that makes it easy for us to work,
learn about a new pgraomming language to be able to be a part of the coding and hopefully contribute to keeping a light mood in the group.
