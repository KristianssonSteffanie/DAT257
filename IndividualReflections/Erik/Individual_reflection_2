What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to put the scrum techniques to use in practice and learn more about how to actually apply them. 
	
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will do my best to help the team get going with the project during our first sprint coming up. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not been able to fully test scrum yet, but during sprint 1 now I will do my best to make sure we follow the guidelines and learn from the
"mistakes we did during the Minecraft lab. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped the team coming up with the idea of the project and helped with the "business model".
