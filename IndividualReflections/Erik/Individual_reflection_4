What do I want to learn or understand better?
So we are still learning about how to create the perfect User stories. We realized that some of them are too large or that some of them are dependant
of each other. So I want to learn understand better how we can create maximum value by creating optimal user stories. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Me and William are learning from each other in the user stories we are working on together. We push each other to focus on what is important and 
what we do not need to act on. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I do try to help our work with user stories by exploring how we can create user stories that are not dependant. I have also helped with creating
the KPI:s and making sure we reflect over what the values we put in means and how it affects us and how we can become better.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and William have contributed by creating the pacman maps. Last week however, there were a few bugs so we have to go back and fix those.
