This week we finished the scrum-plan and some userstories to start with. 
We decided to work with C# because it is more simple when creating a 
game and ther's plenty of help on google.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
To work with C#.
To create userstories that are big/small/good enough.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By talking and discussing about the problem and try to solve it toghether.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Right now i, just like everyone except the scrum-master, comes with ideas and 
discuss where we're at in the timeline etc.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Checking at our meetings if everyone feels they have had enough time and done 
everything they wanted or should have done, we also write to eachother 
on facebook if we need help.
