What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I want to learn more about the reflection part because it will be useful when we are writing our essay.
	
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I share the information I have and if someone in the group needs to understand something better I do my best to help them.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I try to make sure that we as a team follow the guidelines of Scrum and that we each sprint adjust the velocity according to how well we scored in our KPIs and how
  much time we have.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	Last sprint I spent less time on this course because we had final deadline for the bachelor thesis. But me and Erik worked together and still managed to deliver
  our user stories before deadline.
