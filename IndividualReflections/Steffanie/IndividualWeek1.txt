what do I want to learn or understand better?
to use the scrum-work-mode, we used it before a bit but it would be fun to know how to use 
it better and stick to it when using it. Also work in group with people i don't know since before.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
be as pedagogic as possible and hopfully explain in a good way. Always listen to everyones ideeas
and what they want and help them get where they want as much as i can.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I always try to listen to everyone and make sure everyone gets a say in everything. We have not yet started
with the scrum but i hope i give a good effort in this later on.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I want to be sure everything is done when it needs to be ready and make sure people feel that they have done
something and contributed as they thought.
