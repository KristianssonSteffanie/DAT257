What do I want to learn or understand better?
  All the things I have learned in this course will be of good use in our final report. For this project I don't think it is anything more I need to learn now but to a 
  future project there is always more to learn :) For example it would be fun to see how much better it goes in the beginning now that i have some understanding of Scrum.
	
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	If someone in the group needs help I will do my best to help them. I will do it by listening to them explain the problem, or what they are wondering about, and if it is
  something I know I will share myknowledge.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I try to make the group follow the Scrum guidelines, for example when formulating a user story that it should follow the INVEST-criterias. I have also been the Scrum 
  Master so I have made sure that we evaluate our KPI:s each week. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I have delivered what we in the group agreed upon in the sprint planning. I also ensured so that no one had to much work to do because this was the last sprint and we
  needed everything to be completely done. We hade a stand-up meeting in the middle of the week to see if somebody needed help.
