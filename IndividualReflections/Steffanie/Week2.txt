Since last week we have not come so far in the project but we have an idéa now with
some features. The big meeting where we start planning the layout of the work is on
monday week 14, there we're going to discuss our idéas with a TA and get input.

So far the groupdynamic is good and we're all listening to everybodys idéas and 
opinions. We have not decided on a scrum-master yet, but we are going to do that on 
the next meeting i believe and then also plan the first sprint.
