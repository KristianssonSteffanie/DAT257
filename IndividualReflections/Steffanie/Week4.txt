what do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more c# but also get better at the scrum working-process,
you can always do better ;)
  
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We discuss what's difficult and then try together, learn-by-doing is the best!
But also by just having a good comunication helps everyone.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
That i always do the best i can and take my tasks and do them in time, sometimes it's 
difficult to do something in tiome and other times i can take on more tasks.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
That I check my code and etc so it has no bugs when we merge the code, and see
that everything actually works as it should.
