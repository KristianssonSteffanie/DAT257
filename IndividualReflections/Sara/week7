what do I want to learn or understand better?
  Right now I just need to use what I have learned so far in order to finish the project.
   (Writing on the final report)
	
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I feel like I have done well on helping others throughot all sprints by just sitting with them, understanding the problem and then it's been all about problem solving.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	Following my user stories and adjusting the velocity for each.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I have made sure that all the last user stories have been completed and that we have a finished shippable product.
