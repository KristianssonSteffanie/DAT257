What do I want to learn or understand better?
So far we've worked a lot on "production" things such as user stories and trying to make them better, and they have improved a lot, so now I feel like it's time to focus more on reflection and think about things such as what we should do differently if we're starting over. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think at this point, I'm mostly able to help someone else learn by promoting reflection and discussion during our meetings and throughout the sprint. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My main contribution is reflection and discussion about our use of scrum and how we can improve it for the future, if we're all talking about it, that means everyone gets a chance to hear what the others think and that's likely to help us learn. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint my main contribution to the deliveries was scorekeeping and more tools to help the user navigate the application and have a better experience using our product.
