What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I want to understand the Scrum framework and sprints better. During the exercise each sprint were very short so we felt stressed which resulted in that we didn't do
  the planning and reflection part very well.
  
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I will be in phase with the course material so that I can be active in group discussions and try to share my knowledge. If anybody encounter a problem I will do my
  best to help them solve it.
  
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  Will make sure that we follow the guidelines and do not skip any steps on the way, even if they seem boring. Easiest way to do this 
  
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  Structuring our tasks so it makes it easier for the whole group to work. I will finish the task that has be assigned to me before deadline.
