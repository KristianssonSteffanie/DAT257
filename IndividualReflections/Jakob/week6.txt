What do I want to learn or understand better?
A lot of focus so far has been to learn new things, but I haven't thought much about why we are doing what we are doing, so that's something I want to think about while writing the final assignment. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At this point in the project I don't think we want to spend much time and energy on learning new things, but instead making sure we have done everything we need to and making sure the hand-over is good. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Preparing for the final report and making sure what I've learned and what I think scrum is matches the literature, and also making sure to share my knowledge so that it can be used when writing the final report. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I mainly focused on making sure all the parts are working together like they should, I don't want to say "polishing" but making sure everything is the way we want it to before wrapping up the project and adding some final touches.
