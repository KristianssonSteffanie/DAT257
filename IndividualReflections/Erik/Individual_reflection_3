What do I want to learn or understand better?
We decided to write code c#, which I limited experience with, so I am looking forward to learning more about that. Also, I want to learn how to use unity
for creating visual games. 
	
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This sprint, me and William are working together on two user stories. I can learn a lot from him but I also believe he can learn some things from me. 
I have previously worked a bit with game illustratives so hopefully we can learn more about that together. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I will stick to the user stories I have been assigned and stick to the defition of done that we have defined. I will also do my best to make sure
our next sprint reflection will lead to our next sprints beeing even better. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint, me and William are working together and we will do our best to deliver the two user stories we have been assigned.
