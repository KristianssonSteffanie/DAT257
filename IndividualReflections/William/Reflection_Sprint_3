What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I want to understand how to write in c#. I want to continue to learn more about how to use scrum and we as a group have become better and better on it. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I try to be observent if anyone in the group needs help with something and if I have the knowledge I share it. I am also active in our group discussions and share
  some things that I have learnt or problems I have stumbled upon to help the others in the group if they end up in a similar situation.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  As a scrum master it is a bit more responsibility on me to make sure we follow the guidelines of scrum. I held our meetings and made sure that everyone had the right
  amount of workload. I do also question some of our user stories if they are too big or if it is not contributing with any value for our product owner. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  I try to finish my user stories before the deadline each sprint. I also try to make sure that every user story is small enough to be completed in one week. 
One impotant thing here is to break down each user story so it is clear what we are going to do in it. If it is too vague it is hard to estimate the effort it takes.
