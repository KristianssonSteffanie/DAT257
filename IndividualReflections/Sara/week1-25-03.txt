what do I want to learn or understand better?
	I definetely want to understand the sprint and sccrum process better, just to be able to work as efficientely as possible with my teammates. 
   	Now in the beginning, everything is still a bit unclear and we haven't found the right technique yet.     
	But by understanding scrum and sprints better I hope that this project will run way more smoothly.
	
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	If at any point, someone has a problem or need some help, I will do my best to help them.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I feel that I have put in effort as to structure everything up and trying to provide clarity. We have all made sure to try following all the steps. 
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I have contributed in the making sure that this week's deadlines are met.
