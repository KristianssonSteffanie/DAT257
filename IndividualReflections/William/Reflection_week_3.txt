What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about c# since we are goint to write code in it. We will also use Unity which I have never used before so I look forward to learn it aswell. 
	
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In the group we are not afraid to ask questions if it is something that one does not know that well and if I have the knowledge I will gladly try to help and explain
this to the team members. The next sprint I will work togehter with Erik and I think we can learn many things from each other. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I have been scrum master and therefore I had more resposibility that we followed the scrum guidelines. In some cases we were on our way to do more than the 
customer asked for(goldplating) but I stopped it there so we could focus on what the customer actually values. I have also controlled the meetings and made user
stories that follow the format of "as an x I want Y because Z".
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Created user stories and made sure that they are not too big or not too vague. Also learnt a little how to work in Unity so it will be easier in the future. 
Next week me and Erik are working on some user stories together and we aim to finish these so they follow the definition of done we as a group have decided.
