What do I want to learn or understand better?
For this last sprint I want to go more deeply into the reflection part of the scrum use. We soon starting to write our essay and for that we need to
analyze our reflections and the better our reflections are the easier the analysis will be. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope to be able to help the team with the reflection part of the scrum use. Since we are entering the last sprint, it may not be of much use
but the learning part is still important for future work.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I think my contribution to the use of scrum is in the refleciton part. I beleive that we together open up questions and reflect about how we should
have done something differently if we were able to redo a certain step, or sprint, that maybe did not go as planned. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The last sprint I helped implement flooring and fix some bugs. A little less time was spent on this course since we had the final week of our 
bachelors thesis during this sprint, but I will make up for that this sprint.
