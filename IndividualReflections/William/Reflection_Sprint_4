What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I still want to develop my skills in writing code in c#. I have gotten more knowledge in Unity the last weeks but there is always more to learrn :)

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I try my best to help my teammates if it is needed. I try to share my knowledge in the group discussions, especially if I previous have found a solution to a problem
  that is similiar to one that someone else have.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I make sure that we follow the guidelines of Scrum and also that we constantly plan our sprint according to how well we have scored in our KPI:s. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  I try to finish my user stories before the deadline each sprint. I also try to make sure that every user story is small enough to be completed in one week.
