What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the last sprint I wanted to fully understand the different Agile practices that we have used. I think that as we get closer to the end of the
course, it's easier to actually understand the practices since we have struggled with them and been trying to understand and improve on these topics.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since it is the last sprint we as a group have our focus on wrapping up the project. Therefore, there is less focus on learning new stuff this week
but I may be able to help the team with structuring a good delivery and hand-over since I have some experience with that.
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have started to read the literature again for the final thesis to refresh my memory and that has contributed with some new knowledge. Hopefully I can
use that knowledge to help our use of Scrum, and especially our use of Scrum in a potential next project. 
    
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My work has contibuted to solving a few of the problems/bugs we had in our code and on our map.
