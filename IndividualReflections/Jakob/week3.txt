This week we started setting up for the sprints, assigned a scrum master, wrote user stories and we also set up workspaces for everyone to start actually 
writing some code. Wording the user stories turned out to be a bit difficult at first, but after some guidance we learned how to do it properly.
We finished the friday meeting by assigning user stories for the first sprint which seemed to work fine, we were able to divide the project into smaller tasks that 
could be worked on in parallel. 

what do I want to learn or understand better?
- Although writing user stories improved during the week, I still want to understand them in greater detail which will come naturally since we have more user stories
to write in the future. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- By talking about it, the group atmosphere already seems great for this, it seems like we aren't afraid to ask questions if we are unsure about anything. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- This week I contributed by writing user stories, from next week onwards I will contribute by finishing the user stories assigned to me and by coming up with more 
user stories that add value to the customer. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- This week my contribution was mostly setting up a Unity project on github and making sure everything worked as it should for everyone as I seemed to have the most 
experience with Unity. From next week onwards I will contribute by not taking water over my head with workload and making sure I have at least some user stories finished. 
To prevent taking on too many user stories or the user stories being too big in the future, I will use next week to try to get an understanding for how much time 
something takes to implement.
