what do I want to learn or understand better?
  Right now I feel like I understand the process way better and I don't think there's not much more to learn, but rather use what I have learned.
	
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	There have'nt been much "new" learning in this past sprint, but as always I've continued to do my best to help all members of the team.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	I have made sure that the user stories we wrote are according to our standard.
    
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I have completed my user stories and contributed pushing all branches together and fixing the small errors that popped up after the merges.
